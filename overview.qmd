## 1 Theme

The theme we would like to explore is Spatial Point Patterns Analysis.

## 2 Abstract

Spatial point patterns analysis studies the distribution of the points, whether the distribution is random or clustered. This form of analysis can be very useful in the evaluation of events such as crime, traffic accidents, diseases, etc. Thus, we would be able to plan after the analysis and investigate whether there are any dependency relationships between different point distributions to make a comparison and conclusion.

Another kind of spatial point patterns analysis is called network constrained spatial point patterns analysis which allows us to analyse if the distribution of the spatial point events are affected by a network or whether the spatial point events occur alongside a network. 

To illustrate the functions of our Shiny application, we will use Airbnb as an example. 

For spatial point patterns analysis, we would like to find out if the Airbnb locations in Singapore are randomly distributed throughout the country and if not, where are the locations with higher concentrations of Airbnb. Also, at these locations of higher concentration, do the Airbnb locations co-exist with other point events like train stations, hotels, etc.? 

For network constrained spatial point patterns analysis, we would like to discover whether the distribution of the Airbnb locations are affected by the road network in Singapore. Through these analyses, we can investigate whether the distribution of Airbnb locations in Singapore are affected by point events or the road network.

## 3 Problem & Motivation

Geographical data is abundant online for users to use freely. However, many do not know what tool to use or know how to make use of those data since they are in different file formats like geojson, csv, shapefile and more.

The aim of our project is to create a Shiny web application that will enable users to upload their data and help them with the geographical analysis, in particular spatial point patterns analysis and analysis on geographical accessibility. As such, one does not need to be technically trained to do these types of analysis.

## 4 Project Objectives

In this project, we would like our Shiny web application to help users:

1.  Visualise distributions and realise the benefits of spatial point patterns analysis
2.  Conduct spatial point patterns analysis (Kernel density estimation and G/F/K/L functions)
3.  Conduct network constrained spatial point patterns analysis (G/K functions)
4.  Use all the insights gathered from the analysis and models to make practical decisions

## 8 Literature Review

### [Spatial Distribution of Airbnb Supply in Los Angeles](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/cog/ta/2022/00000027/00000004/art00005?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf)

-   Summary
    -   This study investigates the spatial patterns of Airbnb supply. In the city of Los Angeles during the years 2014 to 2019. This study integrates exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and explores the determinants of spatial patterns of Airbnb supply in 2019 with spatial regression models. The results of the spatial autocorrelation analysis show that the spatial distribution of Airbnb supply in Los Angeles is positively clustered and shows a geographical logistical trend over time.
    -   This paper used socio-economic data including employment, population, income, education, and housing units.
-   Learning Points
    -   ESDA (to describe spatial distribution + quantitative models)
        -   For quantitative models under ESDA, the paper covered Global Moran\'s I statistic and the Anselin Local Moran\'s I (LISA) statistic to measure spatial autocorrelation.
    -   (Could consider if we have a lot of time - but not covered in class) Distance between points eg. the city center and Hollywood was calculated using GIS tools. The POI (point of interest) is a specific point location that someone may find useful or interesting, which to some extent can be used to determine the attractiveness of a place. The POI data were obtained from GEOFABRIK (http://www.geofabrik.de/), where OpenStreetMap data was collected, showing a total of 5,424 POI in Los Angeles
-   Linking Back To The Project
    -   We could use the ESDA methods in the paper and explore the use of POI. The paper showed that Airbnb supply is positively associated with the number of POI.

### [Point Pattern Analysis on the 1854 cholera outbreak in London](https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/point-pattern-analysis)

-   Summary
    -   This study talks about the methods Point Pattern Analysis (PPA) and focuses on a case study which is the 1854 cholera outbreak in London
-   Learning Points
    -   PPA plays an important role in conducting exploratory analysis on point data
    -   Commonly used PPA methods are 
        -   descriptive statistics, 

        -   distance-based measures (nearest-neighbour distance, distance functions) 

        -   and density-based measures (Quadrat density, Kernel density).
-   Linking Back to the Project
    -   Like the study, we can implement distance-based measures like the distance functions (G/F/K Function) and also density-based measures (Kernel density) for our Spatial Point Patterns Analysis 

### [Network constrained and classified spatial pattern analysis of healthcare facilities and their relationship with the road structure: a case study of Thiruvananthapuram city](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356962311_Network_constrained_and_classified_spatial_pattern_analysis_of_healthcare_facilities_and_their_relationship_with_the_road_structure_a_case_study_of_Thiruvananthapuram_city)

-   Summary
    -   Network-based location analysis was carried out to find the distribution pattern of the healthcare facilities in Thiruvananthapuram city and also the distribution of healthcare facilities with reference to the network distance (to know whether the distribution pattern of healthcare facilities is clustered or random, whether they tend to follow a speciﬁc direction or whether they are clustered around any speciﬁc point)
-   Learning Points
    -   Centrographic analysis (using Mean Center, Standard Deviational Ellipse and Average Nearest Neighbour) was performed to study the distribution pattern of the healthcare facilities, whether the healthcare facilities locations have a relationship with the road network
    -   To find the distribution of medical stores with respect to the hospitals, cross K function was performed
    -   Kernel Density Estimation technique was applied to modify the centrality values and the vector points to a basic raster framework.
    -   ANN uses the distance between each point entity and its closest neighbouring entity to predict if the point pattern is random, clustered or dispersed.
-   Linking Back to the Project
    -   We can implement cross K function to investigate the location of Airbnbs are influenced by the road network

    -   EXTRA POINT: We could use the ANN ratio (average nearest neighbour ratio) to reveal if a point pattern is a clustered distribution. If the ratio \>1, we can conclude that the pattern is more dispersed than random. A value of 1 indicates a random distribution. To check the statistical significance of the ANN ratio, we will calculate the z-score in order to conclude confidently if the pattern is indeed random, clustered or dispersion.

        -   ![](images/gaa-proposal-1.png)

    -   **\*\*\* for the EXTRA POINT**, we\'re thinking of working on this once the other parts of the project have been completed. Since ANN hasn\'t been covered in class, we were thinking to implement it and draw comparisons with our usual Global Moran\'s I statistic. Question to prof: Is this extra point okay?
