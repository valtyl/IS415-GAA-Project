    "text": "2 Abstract\nSpatial point patterns analysis (SPPA) studies the distribution of the points, whether the distribution is random or clustered. This form of analysis can be very useful in the evaluation of events and we would be able to investigate whether there are any dependency relationships between different point distributions to make a comparison and conclusion.\nAnother kind of spatial point patterns analysis is called network constrained spatial point patterns analysis (NetSPPA) which allows us to analyse if the distribution of the spatial point events are affected by a network or whether the spatial point events occur alongside a network. \nThe application our team developed allows tourists, policy makers and community members to visualise and analyse the distribution of Airbnb listings in Singapore on a map. The app can be used to help better understand the impact of Airbnbs on the local housing market, improve urban planning and enhance tourism development. With our app, users can select and modify their inputs to conduct both SPPA and NetSPPA. \nFor spatial point patterns analysis, we would like to find out if the Airbnb locations in Singapore are randomly distributed throughout the country and if not, where are the locations with higher concentrations of Airbnb. Also, at these locations of higher concentration, do the Airbnb locations co-exist with other point events like train stations, hotels, etc.? Users can use Kernel Density Estimation, G-Function, F-Function, Cross K-Function and Cross L-Function.\nFor network constrained spatial point patterns analysis, we would like to discover whether the distribution of the Airbnb locations are affected by the road network in Singapore. Through these analyses, we can investigate whether the distribution of Airbnb locations in Singapore are affected by point events or the road network. Users can use Network Kernel Density Estimation, K-Function and Network Cross K-Function."

    "text": "3 Problem & Motivation\nOur team decided to develop an application that allows users to analyse Airbnb listings in Singapore and their relationships with other points of interest (MRTs, bus stops etc.) as there is a lack of such apps for Singapore Airbnb listings.\nAfter the COVID pandemic, with travelling becoming the norm and Singapore as one of the most popular cities to travel to in the world, Singapore Airbnb listing information would deem to be extremely valuable. Moreover, with the high cost of living in Singapore, many tourists would turn to cheaper accommodation options like Airbnb rentals.\nIn order to provide a good accommodation experience for such tourists, it is crucial to analyse the current Airbnb listings in Singapore to study the regions where Airbnb listings are most prevalent and why."

In the city of Los Angeles during the years 2014 to 2019. This study integrates exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and explores the determinants of spatial patterns of Airbnb supply in 2019 with spatial regression models. The results of the spatial autocorrelation analysis show that the spatial distribution of Airbnb supply in Los Angeles is positively clustered and shows a geographical logistical trend over time.\nThis paper used socio-economic data including employment, population, income, education, and housing units.\n\nLearning Points\n\nESDA (to describe spatial distribution + quantitative models)\n\nFor quantitative models under ESDA, the paper covered Global Moran’s I statistic and the Anselin Local Moran’s I (LISA) statistic to measure spatial autocorrelation.\n\nDistance between points eg. the city center and Hollywood was calculated using GIS tools. The POI (point of interest) is a specific point location that someone may find useful or interesting, which to some extent can be used to determine the attractiveness of a place. The POI data were obtained from GEOFABRIK, where OpenStreetMap data was collected, showing a total of 5,424 POI in Los Angeles\n\nLinking Back To The Project\n\nWe could use the ESDA methods in the paper and explore the use of POI. The paper showed that Airbnb supply is positively associated with the number of POI.\n\n\n\n\nPoint Pattern Analysis on the 1854 cholera outbreak in London\n\nSummary\n\nThis study talks about the methods Point Pattern Analysis (PPA) and focuses on a case study which is the 1854 cholera outbreak in London\n\nLearning Points\n\nPPA plays an important role in conducting exploratory analysis on point data\nCommonly used PPA methods are \n\ndescriptive statistics, \ndistance-based measures (nearest-neighbour distance, distance functions) \nand density-based measures (Quadrat density, Kernel density).\n\n\nLinking Back to the Project\n\nLike the study, we can implement distance-based measures like the distance functions (G/F/K Function) and also density-based measures (Kernel density) for our Spatial Point Patterns Analysis \n\n\n\n\nNetwork constrained and classified spatial pattern analysis of healthcare facilities and their relationship with the road structure: a case study of Thiruvananthapuram city\n\nSummary\n\nNetwork-based location analysis was carried out to find the distribution pattern of the healthcare facilities in Thiruvananthapuram city and also the distribution of healthcare facilities with reference to the network distance (to know whether the distribution pattern of healthcare facilities is clustered or random, whether they tend to follow a speciﬁc direction or whether they are clustered around any speciﬁc point)\n\nLearning Points\n\nCentrographic analysis (using Mean Center, Standard Deviational Ellipse and Average Nearest Neighbour) was performed to study the distribution pattern of the healthcare facilities, whether the healthcare facilities locations have a relationship with the road network\nTo find the distribution of medical stores with respect to the hospitals, cross K function was performed\nKernel Density Estimation technique was applied to modify the centrality values and the vector points to a basic raster framework.\nANN uses the distance between each point entity and its closest neighbouring entity to predict if the point pattern is random, clustered or dispersed.\n\nLinking Back to the Project\n\nWe can implement cross K function to investigate the location of Airbnbs are influenced by the road network\nWe could use the ANN ratio (average nearest neighbour ratio) to reveal if a point pattern is a clustered distribution. If the ratio >1, we can conclude that the pattern is more dispersed than random. A value of 1 indicates a random distribution. To check the statistical significance of the ANN ratio, we will calculate the z-score in order to conclude confidently if the pattern is indeed random, clustered or dispersion."
